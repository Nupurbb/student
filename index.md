## Tennis
- I have been playing tennis ever since I was 7 years old and it is still one of my favorite things to do with my time. When I was younger I played alot more of singles at tournaments but now transitioning into high school tennis, I play more doubles. This year is my second year at the Varisty tennis team at Del Norte and I am very excited for a fun season with my teamates!
