Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- My classes are CSP, Ap bio, Ap calc, APES, Tennis offroll. I love to spend my free time listening to music, like Taylor Swift. I love to read books and watch tv. I also love to play tennis and play on the Varsity team at DNHS.

- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
